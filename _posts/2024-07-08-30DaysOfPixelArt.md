As someone who wants to develop and eventually publish their own games, I always run into the same roadblock: 

**I suck at art**

I won't dive into what defines art as "good" or not because that'd be an entirely different discussion, but I mean to say *the images I see in my mind never get translated well*.

So, I decided to spend a month learning pixel art.

### Why Pixel Art?
The beauty of pixel art is the simplicity. There's no brushstrokes, or linework, or coloring blended. In fact, most people don't even use a digital pen! The core of what makes good pixel art relies on focusing on the fundamentals:

- Form
- Color
- Lighting

I'll get back to these later, but this simplified approach to art is what (in my opinion) makes pixel art such a great place for beginners.
