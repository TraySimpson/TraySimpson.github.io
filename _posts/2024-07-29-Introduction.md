Technically, it's been 6 years since I first launched this website. 

In 2018, I was a junior in college. I had no idea what I was doing, and decided to make the most basic form of a website I could using GitHub Pages and a single markdown file.

Since then, I've:

- Graduated college with a Bachelor's in Computer Science
- Earned a job and have been promoted several times to Plaftorm Engineer
- Gained a small following on YouTube posting various projects
- Got a cat. His name is Dave
- Learned more than I ever could have imagined in college

and I still have no idea what I'm doing. 

I can't promise that I'll frequently create posts here, but if you decided to check out any of my content I greatly appreciate it :) To officially relaunch this website, I've added a few posts for older projects. Some of them are projects I've talked about on other platforms, but others are completely new.
