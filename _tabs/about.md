Hey! My name is Tray, though you may have seen me on other platforms as "Shifty the Dev".

I currently work as a Platform Engineer, but love learning about new things. In fact, the whole 
point of this website was for me to document various projects and experiments I learn from. Mostly because:

*The difference between screwing around and science is writing it down.  - Adam Savage*

If you happen to enjoy any of the content I post here, or have any questions/suggestions/hateful insults I'd love to hear them! (maybe not the latter) 

Feel free to contact me at {{ site.social.email }}

### FAQs
#### Where did the name "Shifty" come from?
Like all important life decisions, I made this in middle school. It comes from an auto-generated Xbox Live username "ShiftyCow" that I eventually shortened and decided to use as an alias across various creative platforms.

#### How did you learn software development?
After high school I went to Boise State University and got a Bachelor's in Computer Science. However, some of the smartest people I've worked with haven't gone this route. I genuinely think the most important thing is having a passion for always learning new things.

#### How long have you been programming?
The first coding experience I can remember was in 8th grade learning Scratch and how to program as Raspberry Pi with C++. In high school I took another "Intro to Programming" class that covered basic concepts in [Processing](https://processing.org/) and even web development in HTML, CSS, and JS. 

In 2016 I graduated high school, then in 2020 I graduated from college (just in time for Covid to cancel my classes). I landed an intership with a local software company during my last semester, got a Software Engineer offer from them when I graduated, and have been working them ever since.
